# Shiv Rathod Travel Blog
Hello! I am a 23 year old Software Engineer that uses up all his PTO on travel. This website serves to help me document all the places I've been to and to show my future generations I was a cool guy! This site features few of the following experiences:
- My first solo 18 day Trip to Thailand
- Exploring the mediterranian in Southern Italy and Greece with the fam
- Several group trips to Nashville, Orlando and more! 

 Travel has a way of exposing you to the world outside your bedroom. Allowing you meet new people, explore new customs, and discover who you really are. Through this blog I hope to inspire my future generations to get out there and explore the world. Fill all the gaps I couldn't in my lifetime and keep my legacy going on for generations.
